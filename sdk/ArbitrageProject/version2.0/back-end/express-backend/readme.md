## **How to Run:**

+ First make sure you have Javascript package management tools,
  
  such as **npm**, **yarn**, etc. locally.

+ Because the npm installation plugin is downloaded from a foreign server, it is greatly affected by the network and may be abnormal. 
  So it is recommended to use ***cnpm***.
  
  Here we use Taobao source：

  ```shell
  npm install -g cnpm --registry = https://registry.npm.taobao.org
  ```

+ Install the corresponding plugin, the command line such as：
  
  `cnpm i`  ***or***  `cnpm install`

+ run the **`app.js`**:

  `node ./app.js`
